# Changelog

All notable changes to the Hmm-code VS Code extension are documented here.
Follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) + [SemVer](https://semver.org).

Releases are produced by `.github/workflows/release.yml` — push a `vX.Y.Z` tag and CI builds + publishes the `.vsix` to GitHub Releases.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Manual **Compact** button in the chat prompt footer — dispatches `/compact` to compact the session context on demand (same path as the Pi TUI `/compact`).

### Changed
- Auto-compact watchdog raised to 10 min (bundled Pi) so a slow-but-working compaction on a reasoning model isn't prematurely re-armed.

## [0.1.1-rc1] — 2026-05-29

Pre-release (release candidate). Stable remains 0.1.0.

### Added
- **Internationalization (i18n).** UI strings externalized to `l10n/{en,ko}.json` (+ `package.nls{,.ko}.json` for commands). English is the source/default; Korean ships as a locale. New `hmm-code.language` setting (`auto`/`en`/`ko`) — `auto` follows VS Code's display language.
- **Tabbed settings panel** — General / Authentication / Models / Modes. Custom providers now live under Authentication.
- **Per-mode system-prompt editor** in the Modes tab. Defaults are read from the bundled Pi `config.ts`; saving the unchanged default writes no override.
- **`hmm-code.autoApproveDefault`** — start new/resumed sessions with permission auto-approve ON.
- **Configurable context auto-summarization threshold** (General tab) — writes `modes.json:autoCompactThreshold`; default is the bundled Pi `AUTO_COMPACT_THRESHOLD`.
- **Codex usage readout** (Authentication tab) — shows the 5-hour and weekly ChatGPT-subscription limit usage (% used + reset time + plan), fetched read-only with the stored Codex OAuth token. Auto-loads when Codex is authenticated; refreshable.
- OAuth login buttons (Codex / Claude) disable and show "✓ Authenticated" once that provider has an OAuth credential.
- `LICENSE` (MIT), `CHANGELOG.md`, `RELEASING.md`.

### Changed
- READMEs and `docs/*` translated to English and updated for the bundled-`.vsix` install flow.
- Internal cleanup — removed dead exports, deduped helpers (`escapeHtml`, `ansi24`), demoted internal-only `export`s.
- Switched from `--skip-license` packaging to a real LICENSE file.

### Fixed
- Session-picker badge now counts all descendant sessions (children + grandchildren), not just direct children.

### Removed
- `hmm-code.piBinary` setting — single-distribution Pi only. Bundle is always used; if missing the .vsix is broken, not a config opportunity.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-29

First public release.

### Added
- Self-contained `.vsix` — bundles Pi runtime + hmm-code-pi extension. Single install, no separate Pi setup required.
- `hmm-code.piBinary` setting — point at an external Pi binary for power users.
- Sidebar `WebviewView` + editor-area `WebviewPanel` (multiple independent chats).
- Plan / code / debug / ask mode picker mirroring Pi's `setStatus`.
- Model + thinking pickers with `modes.json:modelAliases` support and per-mode override visibility (`Alt+X → default`).
- Interactive tool cards: `ask_user` (with multiselect), `todo_write`, `finalize_plan`, `request_mode_switch`.
- Edit / write LCS diffs with Shiki syntax highlighting (25+ languages).
- Read-result Shiki highlighting based on file extension.
- Ctrl/Cmd-click on tool-call file paths to open in the editor.
- Auto-approve toggle (inline button — session-scoped).
- Permission confirm modal mirroring Pi's `ctx.ui.confirm`.
- Standalone Settings panel — modes / models / auth / custom providers.
- Session picker with parent-child tree, rename + cascade delete, auto-spawn replacement when active session is deleted.
- Auto-resume after window reload via `WebviewPanelSerializer` + persisted last-session.
- Auto-generated session titles (via the bundled Pi extension).
- DOMPurify on every markdown render — blocks `<img onerror>`, `<iframe>`, `javascript:` URLs, etc.
- `Hmm-code` output channel logging launch source + extension path.
- GitHub Actions release workflow + Dependabot for `@earendil-works/*` and runtime deps.

### Fixed
- Auto-resume race: switch_session now guarded so the in-flight target session can't be overwritten by an interim STATE for Pi's temp session.
- Plan handoff race: mode-switch wait is now condition-based (`waitFor(ui.mode === target, 2000)`) instead of a fixed 200ms.
